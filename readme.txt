== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to create a POWr Account? = Yes, you need a POWr Account.  Your account allows you to edit plugins right in your live webpage, and to recreate plugins across many different sites.

= How do I add Mailing List to a page or blog post? = Add the shortcode **[powr-mailing-list label='Enter any label here']** to any page or post. Then visit your live site to edit.

= Can I add more than one Mailing List? = Yes, absolutely!  To clone your Mailing List, just add the exact same shortcode to pages or posts.  To create a new version of Mailing List, add a different shortcode to each page or post, for example: **[powr-mailing-list label='first form']**, and **[powr-mailing-list label='second form']**.

To temporarily hide it, click on your page and then type 'p + down arrow' (the letter p followed by the down arrow). You can show the icon again by typing 'p + up-arrow'.
